    "Welcome to this first tutorial and also the first *Juypter Notebook* of this course! Notebooks allow you to create and share documents that contain programming code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. They have been very popular for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more. This Notebook will test the Python setup on your laptop.\n",

You can run the Notebook step-by-step (one cell at a time) by clicking on a particular cell and pressing **Shift + Enter**. You can also run the whole notebook (all cells) in a single step by clicking on **Cell -> Run All** in the menu.\n",
